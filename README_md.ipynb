        "# Project Overview\n",
        "This project analyzes a telecom customer dataset to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various customer attributes, such as demographics, services subscribed, and billing information, to determine whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., discontinue their services). The primary model used is XGBoost, with preprocessing steps including feature selection and data cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Dataset\n",
        "The dataset (telecom chrn.csv) includes the following key columns:\n",
        "customerID: Unique identifier for each customer.\n",
        "gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents: Demographic information.\n",
        "tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, etc.: Service-related features.\n",
        "MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Billing information.\n",
        "Churn: Target variable indicating whether the customer churned (Yes or No).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Requirements\n",
        "To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:\n",
        "pandas\n",
        "numpy\n",
        "matplotlib\n",
        "seaborn\n",

        "xgboost\n",
        "\n",
        "You can install these dependencies using:\n",
        "pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn missingno scikit-learn xgboost\n",

        "# Project Structure\n",
        "Telecom_Churn.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\n",
        "telecom chrn.csv: The dataset used for analysis (ensure it is in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code).\n",
        "README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.\n",

        "\n",
        "Set Up the Environment:Ensure all required libraries are installed (see Requirements section).\n",
        "\n",
        "Prepare the Dataset:Place the telecom chrn.csv file in the project directory or update the file path in the pd.read_csv() function in the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the Notebook:Open Telecom_Churn.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially. The notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "Loads and explores the dataset.\n",
        "Performs preprocessing (e.g., dropping irrelevant features like Partner, PhoneService, OnlineBackup, TechSupport, OnlineSecurity).\n",
        "Trains an XGBoost model to predict churn.\n",
        "Evaluates the model with accuracy and AUC scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected Output:The notebook outputs the model's performance metrics,\n",
        "including:\n",

        "AUC Score (Train): ~0.844098\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes\n",
        "The dataset path in the notebook assumes the file is located at /content/telecom chrn.csv. Update this path if necessary.\n",
        "The code suppresses warnings for cleaner output, but you may remove the warning suppression for debugging.\n",
        "The drop_features and modelfit functions are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the notebook. Ensure these are included in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future Improvements\n",
        "Explore additional feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.\n",
        "Test other machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for comparison.\n",
        "Handle missing values more robustly if present in the dataset.\n",
        "Add cross-validation to ensure model generalization."
